## Recap of previous classes

### GitHub
GitHub uses Git a distributed version control and source code management (SCM) tool. 
__This means__ we can write code, commit it to a repository on which GitHub will keep track of what has been changed and allows us to always go back in time, hence version control.
__We use__ it for organizing our project and because it gives us the possibility to host the online publication youâ€™ll create via GitHub pages. Remember the first class.

### HTTP
HyperText Transfer Protocol, the protocol used by browsers and webservers to communicate with each other. Browser requests: â€˜please gimme this websiteâ€™ and server responds with â€™sure thing, I got you ðŸ‘Œâ€™.
__This means__ we can request URLâ€™s and get a response in which the body of that response message will be HTML, JSON and/or XML for example.
__We use__ it to have our scraper tools visit websites and have servers respond with data.

### URL
Uniform Resource Locator (AKA web address), a reference to a web source that specifies its location on a network.
__This means__ we can access resources on the web via their address.
__We use__ it to get certain data or do queries so that we get back data that we want. Lots of APIâ€™s from big services such as Twitter, Instagram and Flickr provide these URLâ€™s they call â€˜endpointsâ€™ to fetch data based on a certain query. 

### Node.js
An asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications.
__This means__ we can make our laptops webservers and build our own web applications, YAY!
__We use__ it to build a data scraper.

### Terminal(Mac)/Command Prompt(Windows)
The application provides text-based access to the operating system or Command Line Interface (often referred to as CLI) that allows us to run and give commands to software that is only accessible using the CLI â€“ as opposed to Graphic User Interface (GUI).
__This means__ we can run our node apps via giving node commands in our terminal/command prompt to start our webserver.
__We use__ it to start our webserver and data scraper and to install node packages for our app.
